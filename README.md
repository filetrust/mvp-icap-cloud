## Durable File Processing
Using a Blob Trigger to orchestrate a set of actions to be carried out on the uploaded file.

# High-level Description
The workflow is triggered by a Blob being added to the `original-store` container (in the `FileProcessingStorage` Azure Storage Account). When the processing of the file is complete, a message is submitted to the `TransactionOutcomeQueue`.
